<h2 class="article-subheading">Protected Characteristics </h2>
<p>The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation against applicants and employees, based on certain characteristics. In addition, it prohibits discrimination, harassment, and retaliation based on a perception that the applicant or employee has any of these characteristics or that the applicant or employee is associated with a person who has, or is perceived to have, any of these characteristics. It also prohibits harassment against volunteers and persons providing services pursuant to a contract. The protected characteristics include: </p>

<h2 class="article-subheading">Workplace Harassment</h2>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to, the following, if such actions are based on one of the protected characteristics above:</p>
<ul>
<li>verbal harassment, such as epithets, jokes, derogatory comments, or slurs</li>
<li>physical harassment, such as assault, impeding or blocking movement, or any physical interference with normal work or movement</li>
<li>visual harassment, such as derogatory posters, cartoons, or drawings</li>
<li>sexual favors, the exchange of which is a condition of an employment benefit</li>
<li>unwanted sexual advances</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="article-subheading">Sexual Harassment </h2>
<p>The FEHA defines sexual harassment as harassment based on sex or of a sexual nature; gender harassment; and harassment based on pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. The definition of sexual harassment includes many forms of offensive behavior, including harassment of a person of the same gender as the harasser. </p>
<p>The following is a partial list of types of sexual harassment: </p>
<ul>
<li>unwanted sexual advances</li>
<li>offering employment benefits in exchange for sexual favors</li>
<li>actual or threatened retaliation</li>
<li>leering; making sexual gestures; or displaying sexually suggestive objects, pictures, cartoons, or posters</li>
<li>making or using derogatory comments, epithets, slurs, or jokes related to someone's gender or gender expression</li>
<li>sexual comments including graphic comments about an individual's body</li>
<li>sexually degrading words used to describe an individual</li>
<li>suggestive or obscene letters, notes, messages, or invitations (either in paper or electronic form), and </li>
<li>physical touching or assault, as well as impeding or blocking movements</li>
</ul>
<p>Sexual desire is not necessary. </p>
<h2 class="article-subheading">Abusive Conduct </h2>
<p>Abusive conduct is defined as the behavior of an employee or manager that is malicious and that is "hostile, offensive, and unrelated to an employer's legitimate business interests."</p>
<p>Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>repeated verbal abuse</li>
<li>derogatory remarks</li>
<li>insults or epithets</li>
<li>physical conduct that is threatening, intimidating, or humiliating</li>
<li>undermining or sabotaging another person's work</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, a single action is not considered abusive conduct unless it is "especially severe and egregious."</p>
<p>Abusive conduct, if allowed to occur in the workplace, can result in harmful effects for victims and other employees, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>increased stress</li>
<li>depression and anxiety</li>
<li>eating disorders</li>
<li>sleep disorders</li>
<li>physical ailments</li>
<li>other negative impacts to mental and physical health</li>
</ul>
<p>Employees suffering from the harmful effects above can also experience decreased morale, lower productivity, disengagement, and high turnover.  </p>
